1st part of experiment involves replicating previous research
2nd part of experiment involves replicating with an additional variable (asked to blink - black circle)

No. of red squares generated per quartile
Participants response to red square count

Short (s) or long (L)
circle can appear at 9 intervals ranging between 0.7 and 2.1

Intervals need to be recorded
Response (s/l) needs to be recorded and matched

4-7 squares (oddball)
	if red, record a tick (cumulative) for 50 trials... Example


EXPERIMENT ONE OUTLINE
One trial goes as follows
2 sec fixation - 150ms coloured square - 200ms fixation - 150ms coloured square - 200ms fixation - 150ms coloured square - 200ms fixation - 150ms coloured square - 200ms fixation - 150ms coloured square - 200ms fixation - 150ms coloured square - 200ms fixation - 150ms coloured square - circle (700-2100ms) #---Coloured squares can appear between 4 and 7 times.

Example:
fixation (2sec) - red (150ms) - fixation (200ms) - white - fixation - yellow - fixation - blue - fixation - green - fixation - red - circle (700-2100ms) - fixation (response before loop resets)

After 50 trials, the participant is asked to respond how many red square have been seen, then the process repeats (4 times for a total of 200 trials)



RESPONSE - S or L
RESPONSE - amount of red squares counted


Repeats 50 times
